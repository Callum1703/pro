            <h2> King Tuts </h2>
            
            <p> King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut is one of the main establishments in not just Glasgow, but the whole of the UK’s music scene. With only around a 300 capacity, it feels like you’re in amongst thousands at Tut’s.
                King Tut’s has given us some of the biggest and best in the UK. They’ve boasted names such as Oasis, Paolo Nutini, The Verve, and far more. Not bad for a wee venue in Glasgow, eh?

            <h2> The Barrowlands</h2>
            
            <p>The Barrowlands, need I say anymore?
                Constructed as a dance hall way back in 1934, The Barrowlands has grown into a giant of a venue, if not always in terms of size, then definitely in terms of reputation. The Barrowlands still retains a sprung dancefloor, all the better for bouncing you about. Having spent many a night in the Barrowlands, I can assure you that you'll be bouncing all the way home.
                It's another venue that hosts a diverse range of acts such as Aussie punk rockers Amyl and the Sniffers and US pop star Ice Spice.
                Josh Beggs of 'The Gerry Cinnamon Experience' has also played at the venue. He looked back: "I don't know what to say other than it was one of the best experiences of my life. The crowd were that loud I had to have my monitor all the way up."

                You must be 18 or over to attend gigs at the barrowlands, The barrowlands is located at 244 Gallowgate, Glasgow G4 0TT
